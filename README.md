### A genetic algorithm that finds the correspondance among two sets of label that maximizes their overlap.

Any color you like (named after the Pink Floyd song in *The dark side of the Moon*), it's an optimization algorithm that finds the extremal of a given cost function employing genetic search, it's versatile and can be easily adapted to solve a great variety of problems.   
It has proved to be more efficient, fast and accurate than more modern approaches (i.e. clustering methods). Here you find it's implementation for a particular issue I faced during my Master Thesis in wich I used it to found the highest overlap among two model realization of the same DNA filament obtained as output of independent simulations.

It's
